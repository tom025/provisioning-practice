This repo is intedend for practicing different deployment techniques. I hope to
explore provisioning with chef, puppet and using capistrano recipes outlined
in railscasts episode [337](http://railscasts.com/episodes/337-capistrano-recipes).

This repo will have 3 brances named `chef`, `puppet` and `capistrano-recipes`.
