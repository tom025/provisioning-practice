This repo is intedend for practicing different deployment techniques. I hope to
explore provisioning with chef, puppet and using capistrano recipes outlined
in railscasts episode [337](http://railscasts.com/episodes/337-capistrano-recipes).

This repo will have 3 brances named `chef`, `puppet` and `capistrano-recipes`.

# Provisioning with chef #

For chef I would like to setup my own chef server via `chef-solo` and also set up
my own tests using cucumber as outlined in the book
[Test-Driven Infrastructure with Chef](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020042.do).
